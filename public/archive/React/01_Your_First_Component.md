# Your First Component

components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interface(UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!

## Components: UI building blocks

On the web, HTML lets us create reach structred documents with its built-in set of tags like `<h1>` and `<li>`:

```html
<article>
  <h1>My First Component</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>
    <li>Defining a Component</li>
    <li>Using a Component</li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

This markup represents this article `<article>`, its heading `<h1>`, and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list `<ol>`. Markup like this, combined with CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity, lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdownâ”€every piece of UI you see on the Web.

Reacts lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom "components", **reusable UI elements for your app.**
